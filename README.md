# LLM-Learning
This repository contains a collection of projects and experiments developed while learning about large language models (LLMs). It includes hands-on implementations using Hugging Face Transformers, covering topics such as:
* Prompt engineering
* In-context learning (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot)
